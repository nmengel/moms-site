    <h2 id="phil"> Our Philosophy </h2>
    <p class="purpose2"> Professional Park Pediatrics is your child’s Medical Home. What
    does that mean? Your children’s well-being is our main priority.
    Your family is important to us. We care for each child in a
    comprehensive, well-rounded manner. Our board-certified
    doctors and experienced nurse practitioners specialize in the
    care of children and adolescents. We are in a group practice to
    ensure that help is always available to meet your children’s
    needs. Professional Park Pediatrics follows evidenced based
    guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics and
    recommended vaccines from the Center for Disease Control.

        </br>
        </br>
       In our practice, each patient is assigned to a primary physician
    of their choice. Please do schedule well-child visits in advance
    to ensure availability with your primary care physician.
    Professional Park Pediatrics offers same-day appointments for routine and urgent needs. Same-day appointments are made on
    a first come/first serve basis, we cannot guarantee the
    appointment will be with your preferred primary physicians.

        </br>
        </br>

        Professional Park Pediatrics is proud to have nurse practitioners
        as part of our care team. Nurse practitioners can see your child
        for well-child visits, same-day visits and ongoing comprehensive
        care.

        </br>
        </br>
       We strongly believe in the continuity of care for our patients.
        Please call our office before you take your child to the
        emergency department or urgent care. Need advice after-
        hours? Call our main office line at (850-402-5454) to be
        connected with one of our after-hours nurses. They are in direct
        supervision with our providers to provide after-hours care for our
        patients.

        </br>
        </br>
        Professional Park Pediatrics’ mission is to provide quality,
        comprehensive care from the newborn visit to young adulthood.
        We’re proud to be your child’s medical home!
