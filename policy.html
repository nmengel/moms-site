        <h3 id="fees" class="top"> Fees</h3>
        <p>
            The increasing costs of health care are or should be a concern to all. Advances in technology, expectations
            of
            the public, insurance costs, and inflation all have contributed to the rising cost of medical care . We
            encourage you to pay for services as they are rendered. This keeps down our costs and thus yours. If you
            have a
            question about our fees we would prefer that you speak with us directly to avoid any miscommunication.
        </p>

        <h3 id="insurance"> Insurance </h3>
        <p>
            At Professional Park Pediatrics, we file insurance forms for Capital Health Plan, Blue Cross/Blue Shield
            (PPO),
            United Health, First Health Network (Contact our office for information), and Tricare Select (Contact our
            officeLighthouse
            for information). We accept Medicaid HMOs incuding Wellcare, Humana and Sunshine. Within the
            Healthy
            Kids program, we only accept Aetna Better Health.

            Please make sure your child(ren) are added on to your insurance plan and assigned to your pediatrician of
            choice
            at Professional Park Pediatrics.

            For those insured by other companies, we will assist you if necessary. Our staff will complete insurance
            forms
            for hospitalizations regardless of your insurer if you will obtain the appropriate forms. For those
            individuals
            filing their own insurance forms you will receive a copy of the “super bill” to be used for this purpose.
            The
            original of the “super bill” should be kept for income tax purposes. There is a charge if we have to take
            the
            time to duplicate this information.
        </p>

        <h3 id="records"> Medical Records</h3>
        <p> Medical records are solely our property. As a parent you are entitled to a complete copy upon request. There
            is
            a copying fee. We can release information only upon receipt of a written release. </p>


        <h3 id="room"> Waiting Room </h3>
        <p> We have separate waiting rooms at our office, usually referred to as the
            “Well” and “Sick” waiting rooms. This is to minimize exposure of infants and children who
            are in for weight checks or checkups to patients who might have potentially
            contagious illnesses. If you child is in for ANYTHING OTHER THAN A ROUTINE
            CHECKUP, you will likely be asked to wait in the “sick” waiting room. Sometimes
            this causes hard feelings on the part of parents who feel their children are
            unlikely to be contagious. Examples: “But it’s just a clear runny nose.”
            “But it’s just a low grade fever.” “But it’s just a rash.” “But the rash
            is covered up.” We ask that you defer to our judgment on this matter; there
            are many symptoms that can have an infectious cause that you may not at
            first think could be contagious. Additionally, if your child is in for a
            checkup but has an illness, please let the staff know when you check in
            so we can have them wait in the non-well waiting room and thereby avoid exposing others.</p>

        <h3 id="vax">Vaccination Policy</h3>
        <p>We strongly believe that vaccinating children and adults is the most important measure to prevent serious
            illnesses and promote health. We understand the concerns that you may have as parents and are willing to
            answer
            your questions and discuss the scientific data behind the safety of currently recommended vaccines. We
            follow
            the CDC/AAP recommendation on immunization schedule, and are happy to explain the rational behind it. We do
            not
            recommend alternative schedules. </p>
