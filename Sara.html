                <strong>Sara Barber</strong> is a native of Tallahassee who graduated from Leon High School and then
                went on to
                earn a Bachelor of Science in Nursing and a Master of Science in Nursing from Florida State
                University. Her experience includes working as a Registered Nurse in Labor and Delivery at
                Tallahassee Memorial Hospital. Sara has been with Professional Park Pediatrics since September of
                2002, working a part-time schedule while raising her three kids. Sara loves seeing newborns and
                answering the questions of new parents, having in-depth chats with 4-year-olds about their favorite
                superheroes and counseling tweens and teens through the challenges of growing up. In her spare
                time Sara enjoys spending time with her family--one husband, two dogs, and three kids--as well as
                traveling, reading and watching her kids play a lot of soccer.
