            <p class="bio"><strong>Taylor Ohms</strong> grew up in Perry, FL and moved to Tallahassee after receiving
                her Bachelor of Science
                in Nursing from Florida A&amp;M University. After working as a pediatric nurse for several years, Taylor
                decided to further her education and attended the University of South Alabama where she received a
                Master of Science in Nursing (specializing in pediatric primary care). Taylor has been with
                Professional Park Pediatrics since 2018 and takes a special interest in newborn care and
                preventative medicine. Taylor and her husband Will just welcomed their first child (a boy!) in August
                of 2019. When not at work, Taylor enjoys traveling, FSU sports, and anything to do with water!</p>
