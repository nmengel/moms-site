            <p class="bio"><strong>Walter Bunnell III, MD </strong>grew up in St. Augustine, Florida. He attended
                University of
                Florida medical school in Gainesville, Florida, and completed his Pediatric residency at University of
                Florida
                Health Shands Hospital. After residency, he served as Chief Resident and Assistant Professor at Shands
                before
                moving to Tallahassee and joining Timberlane Pediatrics, P.A., where he practiced general pediatrics
                from 1982
                until 1999. In 1999, he formed Professional Park Pediatrics, P.A.

                He is passionate about following his patients from newborn care to young adulthood. He particularly
                likes seeing
                patients grow up, have children, and return to him with second and third-generation patients.

                Outside work he enjoys gardening, baking bread, traveling and attending Gator football games. </p>
