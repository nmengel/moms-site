        <h3 id="media" class="top">Media</h3>
        <p>Access to internet, TV and games can both help and hurt kids.
            Refer to the guide linked <a
                href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/Media/Pages/How-to-Make-a-Family-Media-Use-Plan.aspx">here</a>
            for information on how to protect your kids online and how to limit their media access.
        </p>
        <h3 id="drowning">Drowning </h3>
        <p>
            Drownings are a leading cause of death in young children. If you have a swimming pool, it should be enclosed
            on all 4 sides by a pool fence (at least 4 feet high) with a lock or latch that young children cannot open.
            Self-closing, self-latching gates are preferable.
            The fence should be separate from the house; your house should not count as the fourth wall. </p>
        <h3 id="car">Seat belt and child safety seats </h3>

        <p>Infants should ride rear-facing until they reach the maximum weight recommended by the seat manufacturer. By
            that point a child can be up to two or more years of age. Once children outgrow their car seat they should
            ride in a belt-positioning booster seat. Children should ride in a booster seat until the seat belts fits
            properly, which is typically when they are 4 feet 9 inches tall, and aged 8 to 12. Children should not ride
            in the front seat until they are 13 years old. Refer to the AAP guide on child car safety <a
                href=" https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/on-the-go/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Car-Seats-For-Children.aspx">here</a>.
        </p>


        <h3 id="bike">Bike safety </h3>
        <p>
            Bikes and skateboards and scooters are wonderful modes of exercise, great for developing balance and
            coordination, but sometimes deadly. They should not be ridden without a helmet and other protective
            equipment, no matter how short the ride. Brain damage will be just as severe and unforgiving on a “short”
            ride as a long ride.
        </p>


        <h3 id="atv">All-terrain vehicles (“4-wheelers”) and motor bikes </h3>
        <p>These vehicles have the potential to cause grave and mortal injury, especially when ridden by children. We
            recommend that children use non-motorized, foot-powered bicycles and scooters instead (with helmets!).
        </p>

        <h3 id="trampoline">Trampolines </h3>
        <p>Trampolines are fun, but tempting to use inappropriately. Only one youngster should be on a trampoline at a
            time and adults should be on the scene to supervise and keep a child from flying off. If an adult cannot be
            present, you should not consider purchasing a trampoline. Even with adult supervision there are inherent
            hazards which may prove unavoidable.
        </p>

        <h3 id="poison">Poisonings </h3>
        <p>
            Poisonings continue to occur despite safety childproof caps (20% of children can manage to get them off and
            20% of adults cannot) and an increased awareness of household hazards. All toxic substances and medicines
            should be stored up where a child cannot climb to get them or in a locked space. If your child has ingested
            or if you think your child has ingested a poisonous substance immediately call us or the poison control
            center (see below). If possible have the bottle or container at hand. Syrup of ipecac is no longer
            recommended.

            <br />
            <br />

            The nationwide phone number for Poison Control is

            *** 1-888-222-1222 ***

        </p>


        <h3 id="dv">Domestic violence and child abuse </h3>
        <p>
            If you are a victim of domestic violence, you can contact Refuge House of Tallahassee for advice and
            assistance. Their phone number is (850) 681-2111.

            If you suspect that your child or a child you know is a victim of physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, the
            number for the Florida Abuse Hotline is (800) 962-2873.
