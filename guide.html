<h3>Appointments</h3>
<p>
        Well baby and well child visits need to be scheduled in advance. 
        It is not uncommon for us to schedule a month or more ahead of time 
        in order to allow ample time for visits for sick children. There may
         be occasions in the office where an emergency will dictate that we see
          individuals out of turn. We do our best to see your child as promptly 
          as possible. We ask that you not to come to the office without calling
           for an appointment first, as this frequently results in a long delay 
           or even an unnecessary visit. If you are not sure if your child needs 
           to be seen, do call and ask our opinion and advice. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you think your child needs to be seen, please call early in the day to allow you the earliest possible appointment. 
        If you are unable to make a scheduled appointment, please call 
        and cancel or reschedule so your appointment slot can be offered
         to another patient. If you are more than 10 minutes late for your
          scheduled appointment, you will likely be asked to reschedule the
           appointment for another time. 
        
        
</p>
<h3>Telephone Calls</h3>
<p> During office hours our nurses, who have been trained by us and have ready access to us, answer almost all of our telephone
     calls to attempt to keep our office flow smooth and avoid waits. They will consult us immediately for emergencies and difficult problems. Routine questions should be asked in the morning during regular office hours. 
     
     <br/>
     <br/>
     After hours, on-call nurses will return calls each hour 
     as we retrieve messages from our answering machine. You can contact the on-call nurse by calling our regular office number 
     (850-402-5454). There is also a cell phone number which can be used to contact the night nurses if your child has a problem which 
     cannot wait one hour; call the regular office number to get the appropriate cell number at that time. 
     
     <br/>
     <br/>
     This night number is for use in urgent situations, not simply for convenience. If you have not been contacted by a nurse within one hour of leaving the message, please call back and leave another message. Be sure to leave your name and correct phone number in the message. </p>
<h3>Emergencies</h3>
<p>A physician is available at all times for emergency medical situations. We can be reached by calling our office number, including after hours. Many times what is frightening to parents may not be alarming to us. Part of our function as your pediatricians is to avoid unnecessary visits and worry. In order to prevent unnecessary visits to the emergency room, we ask that you DO NOT GO TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM WITHOUT TALKING TO US FIRST unless is it a true emergency. Examples include a child who is not breathing or who is turning blue, is having a seizure that has lasted longer than 5 minutes, has ingested a corrosive or toxic substance, has bleeding that is bright red and is spurting, or is unconscious and cannot be aroused. There are other circumstances not listed, but common sense should prevail. </p>
<h3>After-Hours Visits</h3>
<p>There will be occasions when it will be necessary for your child to be seen after hours.
     If your health insurance is Capital Health Plan, you can be seen after hours at the 
     CHP Urgent Care clinic. If you have other private insurance, 
     your plan may or may not cover visits to acute care clinics. Depending on your insurance 
     and what time of night it is, your main option may be the emergency room. Please call 
     the on-call nurse before going to an after-hours clinic or the ER; in many cases, we 
     can give you advice which will enable you to manage the problem at home until regular
      office hours. If you do have to go to the emergency room, we generally recommend 
      using Tallahassee Memorial Hospital. </p>

<h3>Hazards</h3>
<div class="chart_wrap">
        <h4>Television</h4>
        Television can be a wonderful device, but it can also be detrimental to your child's well-being. Set a limit for the amount of viewing. Encourage other activity such as reading, rolling, games, and outdoor activities. Spend some time watching programs with your children. It may prove to be eye opening. If you have cable movie channels, by all means monitor what shows your children watch. Other forms of “screen time” (i.e. TV viewing + computer use + video games) should also be monitored. You child’s total amount of screen time should be no greater than 2 hours a day (preferably less). The AAP discourages television viewing by children less than 2 years of age. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h4>Drowning </h4>
        Drownings are a leading cause of death in young children. If you have a swimming pool, it should be enclosed on all 4 sides by a pool fence (at least 4 feet high) with a lock or latch that young children cannot open. Self-closing, self-latching gates are preferable. The fence should be separate from the house; your house should not count as the fourth wall. Be aware of whether there are pools in your neighborhood; even if your pool is appropriately fenced, other pools nearby may not be. Lakes and creeks and retention ponds pose a similar hazard. Also avoid having containers of standing water in or around the home; 5-gallon buckets filled with water are a notorious drowning hazard for toddlers, who can fall in head first but not tip the bucket over. An adult should supervise swimming children at all times, and children who cannot swim should be within arm’s reach. If there are several adults present (e.g. at a party), one adult should be designated to watch the children to avoid the phenomenon of “everybody’s watching them, but nobody’s really watching them”. 
<br/>
<br/>
    <h4>Seat belt and child safety seats </h4>
        Insist that your children use their seat belts. This means that you must set the example. There is no doubt that seat belts are life-saving and injury preventing. Be sure that your infant is in the proper seat harnessed in the appropriate manner. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations. Tallahassee Police Department can also install your car seat for you. 
        
        
        
        Infants should ride rear-facing until they are 20 pounds AND at least 1 year of age. More recent guidelines recommend remaining rear facing until 2 year of age.  Once children outgrow their car seat (usually when they weigh 40 pounds), they should ride in a belt-positioning booster seat. Children should ride in a booster seat until they are 80 pounds or 4 feet 9 inches tall. This is usually when they are at least 8 or 9 years old. Children should not ride in the front seat until they are 13 years old. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        
        <h4>Bike safety </h4>
        Bikes and skateboards and scooters are wonderful modes of exercise, great for developing balance and coordination, but sometimes deadly. They should not be ridden without a helmet and other protective equipment, no matter how short the ride. Brain damage will be just as severe and unforgiving on a “short” ride as a long ride. DON’T ALLOW YOUR CHILD TO TAKE CHANCES! 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        
        <h4>All-terrain vehicles (“4-wheelers”) and motor bikes </h4>
        These vehicles have the potential to cause grave and mortal injury, especially when ridden by children. We recommend that children use non-motorized, foot-powered bicycles and scooters instead (with helmets!). 
        
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h4>Trampolines </h4>
        Trampolines are fun, but tempting to use inappropriately. Only one youngster should be on a trampoline at a time and adults should be on the scene to supervise and keep a child from flying off. If an adult cannot be present, you should not consider purchasing a trampoline. Even with adult supervision there are inherent hazards which may prove unavoidable. 
        
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h4>Poisonings </h4>
        Poisonings continue to occur despite safety childproof caps (20% of children can manage to get them off and 20% of adults cannot) and an increased awareness of household hazards. All toxic substances and medicines should be stored up where a child cannot climb to get them or in a locked space. If your child has ingested or if you think your child has ingested a poisonous substance immediately call us or the poison control center (see below). If possible have the bottle or container at hand. Syrup of ipecac is no longer recommended. 
        
        
        
        
        The nationwide phone number for Poison Control is
