    <h2 id="phil"> Our Philosophy </h2>
    <p class="purpose2">  Your children’s well-being is our main priority. Our board certified doctors specialize in the care of children and adolescents. We are in a group practice to ensure that help is available at all times to meet your children’s needs. 
        
    </br>
</br> 
In our practice, each patient is assigned to a primary physician of their choice. We make every effort for your child to see their primary physician for their well-child visits. However, night and weekend coverage is handled on a rotating basis by our four physicians. This includes newborn care at the hospital and inpatient care on the pediatric floor of Tallahassee Memorial Hospital. 

</br> 
</br> 
We strongly believe in the continuity of care for our patients. Our aim is to provide truly comprehensive health care through young adulthood.
