    <p class="purpose"> Your children’s well-being is our main priority. Our board certified
        doctors specialize in the care of children and adolescents. We are
        prepared to take care of all your children&#39;s health needs: well-child
        check-ups, illnesses and injuries. We are in a group practice to ensure
        that help is available at all times to meet your children’s needs. 
    </br> 
</br> 
Besides having an on-call physician, our physicians continue to see newborns at
the hospital. In our practice, each patient is assigned to a primary
physician of their choice. We make every effort for your child to see
their primary physician for their well-child visits. However, night and
weekend coverage are handled on a rotating basis by our four
physicians, and you will be cared for by the on-call physicians. This
includes newborn care at the hospital as well as in-patient
hospitalization on the pediatric floor of Tallahassee Memorial Hospital.

</br> 
</br> 
We strongly believe in the continuity of care for our patients. Our aim is
to provide truly comprehensive health care though young adulthood. </p>
