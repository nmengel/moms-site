            <p class="bio"> <strong>Marci Bodine</strong> was born in Tulsa, OK and grew up in Tallahassee. She and
                her four siblings all
                graduated from Leon High School.Â  In 1993 she graduated from Florida State University with a
                Bachelor of Science in Nursing, and in 1996 she earned a Master of Nursing from the University of
                Florida. She worked at Timberlane Pediatrics from 1996 to 1999, and has worked at Professional
                Park Pediatrics as a nurse practitioner since 1999. She enjoys bringing smiles to the faces of
                children and parents with silly things like wildly colored hair and funny Christmas hats. Her hobbies
                outside of work include pets, photography, reading, and New Orleans Saints football--WHO DAT!
