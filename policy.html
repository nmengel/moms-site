<h2> Policies </h2>
<br/>
<h3> FEES</h3>
<p> 
        The increasing costs of health care are or should be a concern to all. Advances in technology, expectations of the public, insurance costs, and inflation all have contributed to the rising cost of medical care . We encourage you to pay for services as they are rendered. This keeps down our costs and thus yours. If you have a question about our fees we would prefer that you speak with us directly to avoid any miscommunication. 
    </p>

<h3> INSURANCE </h3>

<p>We file insurance forms for those insured by Capital Health Plan, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, United Health, Aetna, Tricare. We accept Medicaid HMOs incuding Wellcare, Humana, Sunshine and Lighthouse. 
        
For those individuals insured by other companies, we will assist you if necessary. Our staff will complete insurance forms for hospitalizations regardless of your insurer if you will obtain the appropriate forms. For those individuals filing their own insurance forms you will receive a copy of the “super bill” to be used for this purpose. The original of the “super bill” should be kept for income tax purposes. There is a charge if we have to take the time to duplicate this information. 
</p>

<h3> MEDICAL RECORDS</h3>

<p>  Medical records are solely our property. As a parent you are entitled to a complete copy upon request. There is a copying fee. We can release information only upon receipt of a written release. </p>
     

<h3> WAITING ROOM </h3>
<p> We have separate waiting rooms at our office, usually referred to as the
        “Well” and “Sick” waiting rooms. This is to minimize exposure of children who
        are in for weight checks or checkups to patients who might have potentially
        contagious illnesses. If you child is in for ANYTHING OTHER THAN A ROUTINE 
        CHECKUP, you will likely be asked to wait in the “sick” waiting room. Sometimes 
        this causes hard feelings on the part of parents who feel their children are 
        unlikely to be contagious. Examples: “But it’s just a clear runny nose.” 
        “But it’s just a low grade fever.” “But it’s just a rash.” “But the rash 
        is covered up.” We ask that you defer to our judgment on this matter; there
        are many symptoms that can have an infectious cause that you may not at 
        first think could be contagious. Additionally, if your child is in for a 
        checkup but has an illness, please let the staff know when you check in 
        so we can have them wait in the non-well waiting room and thereby avoid exposing others.</p>
