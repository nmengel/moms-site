            <p class="bio"><strong>James E. Martin MD </strong>received his undergraduate degree from Vanderbilt
                University and completed
                medical school and residency for Internal Medicine/Pediatrics (Med/Peds) at the University of
                Tennessee, Memphis. He has practiced in Tallahassee for over 20 years; since 2002 he has singly
                concentrated on Pediatrics at Professional Park Pediatrics. In his spare time, he enjoys spending time
                with his family, cheering on his favorite sports teams (Go Sports!), and playing live music as a
                guitarist and vocalist with local acoustic power trio “Jim Ed Tim Ed” and rock and roll band “36
                Strong.” </p>
