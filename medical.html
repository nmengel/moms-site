        <li>Fever</li>
        <p class="minim">Fever is a common accompaniment to many illnesses. Very few fevers are harmful in and of themselves. Fever in infants younger than three months of age (rectal temperature over 100.4F) needs to be evaluated immediately.

        <li>Antibiotics</li>
        <p class="minim">A majority of illnesses that children concur are viral in nature, which means that in most cases they will resolve without any specific treatment. Antibiotics do not cure a cold. Antibiotics should be used only when indicated. All medications have potential side effects, some of which can even be life-threatening. Remember we are here to do the best for your child. We will always prescribe an antibiotic when indicated, and choose the one which in our judgment best fits the circumstances. In many cases, there are several antibiotics that we might choose, any of which will be effective. </p>

    <h2 id="safe">Keeping Children Safe</h2>
         
         <h4>Media</h4>
         Access to internet, TV and games can both help and hurt kids. 
         Refer to the guide linked <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/Media/Pages/How-to-Make-a-Family-Media-Use-Plan.aspx">here</a> for information on how to protect your kids online and how to limit their media access.  
       
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <h4>Drowning </h4>
         Drownings are a leading cause of death in young children. If you have a swimming pool, it should be enclosed on all 4 sides by a pool fence (at least 4 feet high) with a lock or latch that young children cannot open. Self-closing, self-latching gates are preferable. 
         The fence should be separate from the house; your house should not count as the fourth wall. 
 <br/>
 <br/>
     <h4>Seat belt and child safety seats </h4>
         
     Infants should ride rear-facing until they reach the maximum weight recommended by the seat manufacturer. By that point a child can be up to two or more years of age. Once children outgrow their car seat  they should ride in a belt-positioning booster seat. Children should ride in a booster seat until the seat belst fits properly, which is typically when they are  4 feet 9 inches tall,  and  aged 8 to 12.    Children should not ride in the front seat until they are 13 years old. Refer to the AAP guide on child car safety<a href=" https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/on-the-go/Pages/Where-We-Stand-Car-Seats-For-Children.aspx">here</a>.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         
         <h4>Bike safety </h4>
         Bikes and skateboards and scooters are wonderful modes of exercise, great for developing balance and coordination, but sometimes deadly. They should not be ridden without a helmet and other protective equipment, no matter how short the ride. Brain damage will be just as severe and unforgiving on a “short” ride as a long ride.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         
         <h4>All-terrain vehicles (“4-wheelers”) and motor bikes </h4>
         These vehicles have the potential to cause grave and mortal injury, especially when ridden by children. We recommend that children use non-motorized, foot-powered bicycles and scooters instead (with helmets!). 
         
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <h4>Trampolines </h4>
         Trampolines are fun, but tempting to use inappropriately. Only one youngster should be on a trampoline at a time and adults should be on the scene to supervise and keep a child from flying off. If an adult cannot be present, you should not consider purchasing a trampoline. Even with adult supervision there are inherent hazards which may prove unavoidable. 
         
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <h4>Poisonings </h4>
         Poisonings continue to occur despite safety childproof caps (20% of children can manage to get them off and 20% of adults cannot) and an increased awareness of household hazards. All toxic substances and medicines should be stored up where a child cannot climb to get them or in a locked space. If your child has ingested or if you think your child has ingested a poisonous substance immediately call us or the poison control center (see below). If possible have the bottle or container at hand. Syrup of ipecac is no longer recommended. 
         
         
         
         
         The nationwide phone number for Poison Control is 
         
         *** 1-888-222-1222 *** 
         
         
         
         
         Domestic violence and child abuse 
         
         If you are a victim of domestic violence, you can contact Refuge House of Tallahassee for advice and assistance. Their phone number is (850) 681-2111. 
         
         If you suspect that your child or a child you know is a victim of physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, the number for the Florida Abuse Hotline is (800) 962-2873.

    <h2 id="dose">Dosage Charts</h2>
    <div class="chart_wrap">
        <p>The most commonly used medication for controlling fever is acetaminophen (e.g. Tylenol). When it is deemed appropriate to lower fever, the maximum dose of acetaminophen is 15 mg for every 2.2 pounds. Another easy rule of thumb is 80 mg per 12 pounds of body weight. It is better to slightly under-dose than overdose. The strength of each of the preparations is written on the boxes or bottles. Acetaminophen infant drops have 160 mg per 5 mL (the more concentrated infant drops of 80 mg per 0.8 mL have been discontinued). The children’s elixir has 160 mg in each teaspoon (or 5 mL) and the chewable tablets have 80 or 160 mg per tablet. If your child can’t or won’t take/keep down medicine by mouth, acetaminophen rectal suppositories are available (e.g. Feverall); the dosage is the same as the oral formulations. </p>
